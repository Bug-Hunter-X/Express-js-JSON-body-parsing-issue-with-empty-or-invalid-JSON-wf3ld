# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON payloads in Express.js applications.  The problem arises when the request body is either empty or contains invalid JSON data.  The server fails to correctly parse the request, potentially leading to unexpected errors or incorrect behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided Express.js application uses `express.json()` middleware to parse incoming JSON requests. However, if the request body is empty or contains invalid JSON (e.g., malformed JSON syntax), the `req.body` will be empty or undefined, causing the application to fail to process the data as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully handle cases where the JSON parsing fails.  This involves using a `try...catch` block to catch errors during the `JSON.parse()` operation. If an error occurs, appropriate actions can be taken, such as logging the error, sending a custom error response to the client, or falling back to default values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:3000/data` with either an empty body or invalid JSON data.
5. Observe the console output or the server's response to see the issue.

## Solution Implemented

The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code that includes error handling for the JSON parsing process, resolving the issue.
